MVP 08 05 2020 - how to war
3 units, 3 enemies
2 bases, win by destroying
exp constantly
atk up spam
hp up spam
revive
1 tactic
1 passive
1 skill

respawning:
they are always on field. it doesnt matter if they die.
exp gain is constant or on kill or attack
skills to create delay for your enemy
tactics that focus base -> but don't get any exp for hitting base
no base and limited count of same soldiers... i want single soldier that you sort of guide and take care of.
limited count with base and with cooldown
ablities that let you destroy enemies vs abilities that focus on base
they are meat shield
and it's hard to bounce back

base unit deployment -> leave base without defences but get additional offence power
if base unit dies... you are in trouble
up to 5 hp of those deployments
you lose 1 hp by sending it out OR win the game
1/3 types of bases.
units can't respawn without base command
double armor on base outside, to prevent it from going down faster then enemy base when 1 on 1. it should deal damage and be worth it with maximum protection.
maximum unit count multiplier. or choose tactical multiplier in certain situations.


revive costs half of pack of base health, but gives exp bost.
