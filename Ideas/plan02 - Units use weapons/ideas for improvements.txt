how do all these weapons, tactics and upgrades, actually even impact the gameplay?

because it feels like, it's just a slow slog of upgrading units, until you win
wait until base all on enemy and win.
it's like very linear.
too fast to let you think

--- i guess i could design it in a way to make it hard to scale up. like in star craft, if you have a numbers game, you win.
--- armor and anti armor weapon work well. magic and magic shield or some other cacle of countering.

other things, like weapons to collect? --- pickable items that they go for if they are near.
change dynamic of enemies? --- 1 defends, others random
change turret strength? --- larger range, slow. --- and multiple turrets


maybe objectives are too small, and things  happen too quikly to be able to think properly
->moving map

upgrades aren't next to each other.
less predictability in tactics.

ui timer for respawn
--- better visuals for who units are focusing

--- changing tactics is kinda random instead. wonky.
--- which count add mechanic of food. and angry units. or angry barracks. and slaves.

slowing units down gives you some micro
weapons don't actually increase range -> mages archers
buildings?

maybe i also don't want kingdom rush to limit me
upgrades aren't necessary

large amounts of units?

skills would just make it easier
countering enemy weapons
elements that counter each other

costs for ugrades should go up with leveling collectively, not per upgrade
+3 hp vs +2 atk. plus they can have multiple things in upgrades.

new self healing unit
other units.
