Game about builder blocks and researchable AI

Everything should be researchable. Movement, rotation, health points, flying, targeting, spawning... And everything should be editable. Movement 90% effective. Spawning 30% effective. And everything should be built from basic blocks.
It should be like playing with legos.
This allows for mixing results. For example mixing movement, with rotation and targeting give us fliers. Spawning plus rotation plus gravity should give us barriers.
