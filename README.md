# Blocker
**Game about builder blocks and researchable AI.**

Everything should be researchable. Movement, rotation, health points, flying, targeting, spawning... Research should be editable. Movement is 90% effective. Spawning 30% effective. Building are created with basic blocks and research.

It should be like playing with legos.

This allows for mixing results. For example mixing movement, with rotation and targeting give us fliers. Spawning plus rotation plus gravity should give us barriers.

First stage: 

Basic prototype that shows the idea, without actual gameplay goals.

Features:
- [x] research menu with items that can be edited
- [x] units that can move, target, rotate depending on picked research.
- [x] information map (like x-ray vision)
- [x] units can spawn, die and give money.

Second stage:

Gameplay goals, experimentation, understanding of key time sinks in this sort of project.

28.03.2020 - 03.05.2020

Features:
- [ ] offers one full simple level to beat.
- [x] ui, background.
- [x] explore a few ideas around using different blocks.

Results:

I've created a prefab system for creating codeless games. It's pretty neat in some cases and in others it's pretty difficult to use because of readability and how much it's necessary to jump between the files. I'm thinking of creating some sort of editor for this. I'll add it to third stage.

Now for game, i'm thinking of changing directions a little. This game wasn't really fun that much. I'll try something with a bit simpler rules. I could keep the sliders as main mechanics and maybe not go in rts. Maybe something simple like shield management system.

Biggest time sunk at the moment is setting up, and especially fixing broken prefabs. It's flexibility is great though.

Third stage:

More experimentation based on speed of development. Developing a few features to feature a few levels.

--> 03.05.2020

Shield/energy management game.
